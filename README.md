# Shopping_Cart
This is a shopping cart where you can add items to you cart and the stock of the item updates.

## Description
You can add items to your shopping cart, update the shoping cart and the stock of the item in the "warehouse" reflects the changes. In this application I used a Strapi database to get items to restock in teh warehouse. I also used Postman to test the APIs for my databse.

## How to Run
Clone the Shopping_Cart repo to your local computer. Next you will need to use npx http-server to spin up a local server. Finally, navigae to that localhost port specified.
